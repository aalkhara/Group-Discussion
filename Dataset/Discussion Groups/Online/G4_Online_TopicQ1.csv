P15,12/04/2018 14:04,comment,J,,"In terms of procedural justice, there a complications in the methods to determine convictions. For instance, can we justify the death penalty for manslaughter? I do agree with other comments that suggest political malpractice that could manipulate the death penalty for corrupt government goals. Within this there is a concern over current laws on humanitarian topics such as illegality of certain sexual orientations or cultural allowances of discrimination.
Regarding distributive justice, although it may for a time satiate grievances, the death penalty does little to address the origins of issues. Thus I believe attention should be more focused to rehabilitation and prevention programmes.

P11,43202.54544,comment,Abeer,,"Personally , I think that some heinous crimes should be punishable by death , even if this is not going to heal the wounds of victims  but I will send a strong statement for people not to do it.   for example , premeditated killing someone is not acceptable if I'm going to regret it years later. However , for the current time , legal systems are full of problems or corrupted. Especially in some countries where governments can do that to punish their enemies, so I think no as it as it usually end up killing more innocent people.

P12,12/04/2018 12:04,reply,Bob,,Not necessarily the government. People know morals and there are a kind of stranded (acceptable) behaviour.,http://aalkharashi1.wixsite.com/discussion-topics/soical-networks

P13,43202.50365,reply,G,,"There's positive freedom and negative freedom, i.e., freedom to live your life without being discriminated against or without being targeted by violence (in this context, this could be hate speech). Neither of these cannot be fully enforced without limiting the other one. And I disagree that people know morals and share the same acceptable behaviour - this can wildly differ between different social groups (there are a lot of people who think that FGM is acceptable). So you can have social media with very little or even without any regulation, but it will almost certainly violate the negative freedom of some, perhaps more vulnerable members of the society.",http://aalkharashi1.wixsite.com/discussion-topics/soical-networks

P12,12/04/2018 12:04,reply,Bob,,But it does: it implies that is OK to kill someone if they are found guilty of breaking certain laws. ,http://aalkharashi1.wixsite.com/discussion-topics/politics
