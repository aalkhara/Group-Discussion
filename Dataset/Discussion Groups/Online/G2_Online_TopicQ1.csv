P5,12/04/2018 13:04,reply,filomena,,"I think the bias of people is that if something is not acceptable, the only solution is a strong punishment. But, If we don't match it with something that help the guilty, the only punishment is not useful. Clearly, I think also victims need more support by society, because they often believe that they need only of justice, but this is not enough to solve the trauma.",http://aalkharashi1.wixsite.com/discussion-topics/politics
P5,43202.462,comment,filomena,,"I don't agree with the death penalty. I think that if a person commits a murder, it's necessary a number of years of  imprisonment that is adequate, not only, to the crime, but also to the possibility of a social rehabilitation.
Punishment must be corrected during detention if the perpetrator improves his ability to return into society through a social rehabilitation program.
The death penalty teaches nothing and does not make our society better, while social rehabilitation during imprisonment could be an advantage.",http://aalkharashi1.wixsite.com/discussion-topics/politics
P5,12/04/2018 12:04,reply,filomena,,I do't think the death penalty justifies killing people.. They kill people without to think the possible consequences or they think do not be discovered by police..,http://aalkharashi1.wixsite.com/discussion-topics/politics
P5,12/04/2018 12:04,reply,filomena,,"So, if the death penalty justifies killing people, do you think that without it the murders number could be less? .. I`m not sure about this..",http://aalkharashi1.wixsite.com/discussion-topics/politics
P4,43202.46194,reply,Konstantina,,"I don't know about that. For an average person, yes, they will see their friend’s baby or cat pictures showing up, but that can cause them stress and sadness if they haven't sorted their life out yet. Also social media can have major impacts, such as using them to organise protests (eg. Arab Spring) or to manipulate votes (eg. Cambridge Analytica).  I am still very perplexed on this topic...",http://aalkharashi1.wixsite.com/discussion-topics/soical-networks
P4,43202.42042,comment,Konstantina,,"I have not yet set my mind to this one. It is too early to have an opinion for something it is still being formed. Since we do not know what having social media really means but they are here to stay, we should divert the question of how we regulate privacy data and crime committed through them (e.g. grooming). There is no point in fighting the future, we need to adapt to it and mould it to the best of our interests.",http://aalkharashi1.wixsite.com/discussion-topics/soical-networks
P4,12/04/2018 10:04,comment,Konstantina,,"My aversion to crime makes me wants to agree. However, my education has taught me the the capital punishment has no places in a Democratic society. So, I am leaning to ""no"".",http://aalkharashi1.wixsite.com/discussion-topics/politics
