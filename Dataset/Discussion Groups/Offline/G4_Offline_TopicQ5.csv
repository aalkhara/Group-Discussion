P8,Q5,12/04/2018 12:00,"That. You have. To like. Every like everything had a. Good side and bad side. But, it is filling a gap. Because like millions of users use it now. So. It is actually a good thing, apparently. How to use it. Or. If you like. If you come to the television. I didn't know. Drinking whatever. Anything in the world that just has a good side and a bad side. So if people use it wrongly. Yeah it is bad. It's a good thing."
P13,Q5,12/04/2018 12:00,Yeah. That doesn't mean. BREAKING. People's privacy. Breach. 
P12,Q5,12/04/2018 12:01,Like Facebook. 
P13,Q5,12/04/2018 12:01,You know what he's facing several data breaches. Otherwise it's good.
P11,Q5,12/04/2018 12:01,Yeah. I mean that. We didn't realise how powerful our information like. For me. Yeah. Like can. Can get. These points we didn't really. Consider it to be happening. It's technology that we developed. Our mistake apparently that we did. 
P13,Q5,12/04/2018 12:01,I don't think they'll be that satisfies each and every aspect.
P15,Q5,12/04/2018 12:02,I guess it's largely the way things are are saying it's not necessarily psychology inherently negative but that's all. It's the way. It. Yeah especially with the claim that students who are heavy social media users tend to have lower grades like that's. Like a correlation or a causation doesn't necessarily mean because of social media they have bad grades. They may just have bad grades in general or just have bad habits and therefore use social media and also I filtrate so. It's lots question there.
P13,Q5,12/04/2018 12:02,It's good.
P12,Q5,12/04/2018 12:02,And the same time you don't get thoughts from. For example research you need to know very-well to boost your research. Why but you still have it on Twitter. Yes. So with good things to think about is social insurance for things like I don't want to share right now. Yeah.
P14,Q5,12/04/2018 12:00,But social media. Just. Depends on What you're doing now.
P13,Q5,12/04/2018 12:03,Yeah I think our focus here is not our behaviour toward the tool.
P14,Q5,12/04/2018 12:03,"Yeah Yeah, I got it I got it."
P13,Q5,12/04/2018 12:03,"The focus. The tool is beneficial to our society or not. For me, I think it's very beneficial."
P14,Q5,12/04/2018 12:03,Yeah. For sure.
P13,Q5,12/04/2018 12:03,"Regardless of my behaviour and your behaviour, my intention and your intention. "
P11,Q5,12/04/2018 12:03,If you think. Like. I didn't know from economical way that a lot of people start doing business through social media. This point Yeah and these people wouldn't have this kind of. Job. A lot of people working for them. Improving the. Economy of. This. Country didn't have this kind of tool. Because some people it's really hard to go outside and go to other jobs. But. People.
P13,Q5,12/04/2018 12:04,I remember first being here. My friend from Ghana Told me oh don't buy a phone from any shop. I'll get you one from Facebook and I was about to go looking for shops and immediately he bought the phone for me.
P12,Q5,12/04/2018 12:04,It used to be the way to contact people. I. Think it's a great time as well in different countries. There are different. Uses. Different type of technology being used in there for example here in U.K. they use facebook much more than. Other. Like. Said. Than Twitter maybe or Instagram WhatsApp but other countries they use. Different. Websites. Yeah and it can be used politically either in a good way or bad way you know to. Change. The political view to. Encourage people to do something to. Change the regulation. You know. So. Yes can be a good thing. Is it. Used in a positive way or can bad thing if it's used for. Whatever. Reason. Not. Good.
P11,Q5,12/04/2018 12:05,For the second. Group. Social media like privacy is exposed to Government. I think this is. Good news for example me. Do you think this is more of a problem with law enforcement. Because this technology is. Relatively new. It's not really these people it's not really up to these. And we still need time to. Build. Some kind of. Laws. That will manage this kind. Of. Social media rules. And that the data management Control.
P13,Q5,12/04/2018 12:06,Yeah
P11,Q5,12/04/2018 12:06,I think this is a problem with the government not the actual social media.
P15,Q5,12/04/2018 12:06,Recently there's a crackdown with GDRB GDBR the new. Social media or media. Laws. Are Just passe Svetozar. I think it's coming out just like fully released in June. So like. Yeah. So I don't know any apps recently but they like how this whole thing like. You can do what you were talking about. For. So. There is a. Strong issue of privacy.
P11,Q5,12/04/2018 12:07,I think. The. Fiscal problem I think more countries will start. Building. Of. Laws. And. So I. Predict. That. People. The. Concept of. Big countries or strong countries can force this kind of close with. Countries. That. Truly want to have this Influence to stop them. The problem. Is. This social media start to being something global. In. The. Country. And Facebook. Google in this kind of. Stuff. Because they're. Too small to be considered like American. Or something. Known. As. Global things that. We don't know how to. It. Or. Force them. To. Apply to them. And. We are going to be part of this problem to. Be dealing with how to enforce these rules actually. And. Networks. Compete with the others.
P11,Q5,12/04/2018 12:08,And how about the last One?
P14,Q5,12/04/2018 12:08,Cons?
P11,Q5,12/04/2018 12:08,Yeah stress and relationship problems
P14,Q5,12/04/2018 12:08,More on online relationships more than a lack of life lessons. I think. It's not. Just people talking about networking online. For example LinkedIn or. Facebook or whatever but. In reality. There is nothing. Just like online people you know them both virtual Yeah it's actually. Really.
P13,Q5,12/04/2018 12:09,Virtual relationship. Virtual which means haha
P11,Q5,12/04/2018 12:09,I think it's not a problem. That. cased by Facebook. Just like Modern society. Actually. We still Have to deal with. The. Because. People get a. Problem with the relationship. Without. The. People that want more.
P12,Q5,12/04/2018 12:09,With these jobs. It's like. Getting lost because normally when you walk. Anywhere or. Go anywhere. Meet any person normally find people around you like using their phone and they know it's like. Because of their in talking to people around them. You know. So nothing at all just like being there. But not there is no connection at all. Using phone or not. Nothing. Just contacting their virtual friends.
P11,Q5,12/04/2018 12:10,We have to deal with it.
P14,Q5,12/04/2018 12:10,The generation. I mean when I sit with my nephews and nieces they are. Just. Playing with their phones and. I start talking with them what's going on with you guys. Talking to you. an they say we are in the middle of phone conversation then I say Yeah that's ok. I will play with my phone too
P13,Q5,12/04/2018 12:10,It's. Great problem that you are facing deal with culture. Information Age. We. Need to. Set up strategy to deal with that. Otherwise. the tool itself is inefficient to our society
P11,Q5,12/04/2018 12:10,Doing what it's supposed to do. We're getting. More Visual. I mean. We are the problem of FaceBook.
P12,Q5,12/04/2018 12:10,In the same time. There's a good side of it which is. The last point the. Positive Side which is. Not. Conducting. Connected. To. Like. My situation to my back home. There is anything new mean changes so it's easier to. Be updated about anything in there. And. I think it's not too frequent because normally it's hard to follow up on. The news updates. With. The style of. Communication is easy.
P11,Q5,12/04/2018 12:10,You feel like home.
P12,Q5,12/04/2018 12:10,Exactly
P13,Q5,12/04/2018 12:10,Feel like it's really hard to be really hard and very peaceful. Yeah. Yeah.
P11,Q5,12/04/2018 12:10,You Personally change on phones now the social media phones. 
P14,Q5,12/04/2018 13:10,That. Makes it. Easier than before. Oh yeah yeah. I phones. Smartphones. In general.

P14,Q5,12/04/2018 12:13,Yeah. Like before. I used to go to the loft to. Talk with my family via Skype. Because. The laptop. When it. Gets to. Smartphones. We comes up with your family.
P11,Q5,12/04/2018 12:13,Make it Much easier. Makes more isolated
P11,Q5,12/04/2018 12:13,Everywhere you just think.
P14,Q5,12/04/2018 12:13,You can't sit by yourself.
P11,Q5,12/04/2018 12:13,You can. Always. Have to talk. To The phones.
P14,Q5,12/04/2018 12:13,Yeah. So. Far
P15,Q5,12/04/2018 12:13,I think everything in moderation. We just need to learn how to. Use technology properly. If you.
P11,Q5,12/04/2018 12:14,Like everything else.
P15,Q5,12/04/2018 12:14,Exactly
P11,Q5,12/04/2018 12:14,So. This is. It Has been the same for television video games. Look for other things too. Personally. I. Think. It's just. What you challenge. To me.
P15,Q5,12/04/2018 12:14,No matter what it's not going away you have to know.
