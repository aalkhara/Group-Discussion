P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:01,"The use of social network has some pros and cons. The original idea of social networking is good because the original idea to share information and to connect people to socialise so is 
socialization is a good advantage weed reduces social network but there are lots of problems because the first a lot of 
false information is harder to discriminate between and false information especially is a problem for younger people they think because name create 
an idea of some topics and subjects that are completely wrong also the general idea of the life, what’s the life? What is socialization? What is the 
communication? The other problem that this dissertation is not a good situation because you don't know very well we are the people and the problem of 
the most I think not masturbate a lot of the Yankees that spend too much time near comfort computer and then the improvement Association the real life today. 
Today in the psychological effects of them with respect to this kind of problem she's a he became the use of Internet addiction support and respect people the
government controlled about 2 hours use of networking I think that government of two together more rules for example to control the society that put information in the internet "
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:02,Like China 
P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:02,"yeah yeah yeah Which city is the company that put advertisement because you go to get first I'm using it for me so big problem when they use social networking because 
I have an invention or advertisement and it's a bit stressful this kind of advertisement you click on a website and appeared to be advertisement . 
You cannot close the advertising before 10 or 15 seconds setting all this kind of invasion of false information they are not good for out for our, 
our healthy our psychological healthy and they think that the first action have two different sizes of the government not just so people because all 
I see is not simple to manage all kind of problems so what the problem is our government, I think. Mkes me feel upset also"
P4,Q5,12/04/2018 11:03,"You made a lot of different points in your speech.  I have a lot of points that i want to address, but I would like to focus on the main points, 
i think a lot of them is what you just said. Also, a lot of pros and cons that listed here. They kind of based under the assumption that the problems 
identified here and some of them identified by you, that are caused by social media but I tend to disagree that social media like never exits. 
It’s always exists like with the reputable society. It just enhance the way people behave so it's just, maybe it’s easier if i try to illustrate with an example. 
So, where it stays that social media enables the spread of unreliable and false information, 
I don't think this is true I think that it only makes it possible to spread false information faster and to spread on larger scale but the spread of false information, it was always existed."
P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:05,In what way we can quickly recognize the false information? I don’t know
P4,Q5,12/04/2018 11:06,"I think it’s all about educating users about how recognize false news, about how to identify reliable sources and encouraging independent thinking. 
Also, disencouraging and bad healthy habits and bad healthy lifestyle. This way people can use social media platforms without having a negative effects in their 
social life without being a victim of addiction. I think lots of these negative habits people develop regressive habits and they have natural tendency because we human we always 
go with the easier way, and a lot of times it’s easier to socialize online than it’s to go out, meeting people -- someone who is highly shy. 
So in the same way that enforcement law use to catch criminals. Also criminals can make use of social media, the problem still exists and it would exist without the social media, 
they would just different form, I think?   To say about the government, I also disagree that the government should significantly interfere. I think either some regulation might be necessary. 
For example, protecting private data of citizens, and remembering the Facebook incident, which happened so recently. "
P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:06,I think the disadvantage is that you have less freedom of the government put a lot of rules and what kind of people you can find on the internet.
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:07,"I think you're right. I remember one of my frenids he is chineese and said that they have thier own soical media or soical network website like Facebook or twiter. 
So all members of that website are from china and they are not open to the world. I think this is the adantage of government control of social networks websites"
P7,Q5,12/04/2018 11:07,"I don't think it's necessarily the problem with china, I think the problem with china is that the government can define different things that are allowed to be discussed"
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:07,We are taking china as an example
P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:07,I think China is an extreme example
P7,Q5,12/04/2018 11:07,"The government controls what kind of discussion points can be made, I think this can quickly kill the discussion"
P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:08,"I think the example of china is a bit extreme, I mean I intend a government like American government or european government can put rules to control, for example the company that put information 
on the internet or for example Facebook if it catches a lot of our information and the government has to control this process."
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:08,"I think this relates to a cyber-attack wars between these countries like US, UK, China and Saudi Arabia and different countries. So they try to control their people from spreading 
information in public social networking sites. For, example, I’m going to a holiday, going to Liverpool for one week, so maybe someone will track my location to steal things from my 
home while I’m away. So, this is the main concern for me when I’m losing the social media. Privacy, there is no privacy for the social networking. Whatever you post online it’s for 
everyone to see. It doesn't belong to you anymore. I think, the owner of social networking like Facebook or twitter they need to teach users how set their own privacy to protect their 
information from misuse. We’re using just for fun, we’re carless."
P7,Q5,12/04/2018 11:09,"You wanted to share that you’re going to holiday and I you should be able to do that, but be clear who you’re sharing with and what privacy you’re giving up. 
I don’t think it’s necessary to impose rules around privacy. You should be clear that you’re giving up that kind of information."
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:10,"Yeah, you’re right, for me I know the rules, the privacy rules in Facebook, so only my friends going to see the post. But, someone who has no idea about the technology and don’t 
know what the privacy really mean, can be an issue. "
P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:10,"I think that when you know how to use Facebook then you manage your privacy, but the problem young people prbly are not responsible and do not have the knowledge to manage thier privacy 
So, I think also the government has to orginze soical events. I do not know, to educate people use the internet toward the pricvay and how to use the privacy beause most of the people use 
the internet just to give our infomation my holiday, my boyfreind."
P4,Q5,12/04/2018 11:11,"Yes, I defently agree on understanding what you exactly doing on the social networking website is very important, but also I think the recent Facebook exmaple it shows also the actor 
who creates the social networking website might have business interest that interfer kind of good cause, like for example, misburger allowed data to be leaked. 
It also shows is not all down to the user. But the actor behind the soical netowrk might meet the violation of private data withiut the consent of the user"
P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:12,"I think even if we put the restrications in our pricay, it is not enoungh becuase the web for example, Facebook are able to capture our information. We don not know, for example, sometimes 
I look for an aprtment to go on holiday, and then I open my mail and I have the advertising of an aprtment in the place I checked."
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:12,Yeah it happend to me last week.
P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:12,"So, I can not control this kind of effect becuase the government has too much freedom to capture our information. 
So, I think only the government can only get some actions to change this kind of process."
P4,Q5,12/04/2018 11:13,"But we are talking within the context of western government, but there are a lot of diffrent governments in the world, for example, in Trkey I rember when the government took contol 
of social media espaicply when there were protesting and a lot of people are aginst that the society is very divided and a lot of people want to hare lets say polioce violance on Youtube
or Facebook just to see what's happinging, but this content is ofter taken down and a lot of people have been arrested for sharing something that disagrees with the offical position
aginst their policy. So I don't think it's good. The govenment can use social media to hurt citizens as well. So I think it's different from one conutry to another"
P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:14,Yeah I think it depends on the country. This the problem maybe that we have different cultures and different rules is bit complicated
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:15,"I think it's time consuming as well. For me when I come here to my office in the university, I put my mobile in silent mode and then I looked, at the end of the day I take my mobile. 
So I just try to save my time because I'm a big fan of following famous people in Twitter, and I like to make an argument and debates about specific topic about politics debates. 
So I just realized that my time is consumed and my performance in the university goes down and affects my productivity. So I decided to silent my mobile and focus on my work. 
So this is another disatna the of the social networking, because once you enter any debate or an argument, you can not get out, your mind is still thinking about the topic. 
You can not focus in your task."
P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:16,"Yeah, this is right, but the problem that a lot of young people are not able to silence their phones, for example, I know in the past a patient young guy that was addicted to online video 
games and which you have to play and engage with other people and he was not able to pause and go for example to the bathroom. It was strange addiction. It is a problem of family and parents
because they are not able to educate these people, but it also a problem to our society."
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:17,I think we agree to sum up the education and to increase the awaness of end users. I think these are the most important for the sociality and social networking
P4,Q5,12/04/2018 11:17,"I think social media has benefits, but you have to find the blance."
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:17,"Yeah, and they have to respect our privacy as well. Even as I said I was in Liverpool last week, I disabled the location from Facebook. When I arrived here to Glasgow, 
they send me kind of ads from Liverpool. How come? But in the privacy I disabled everything that shows my location, so they still know where am I."
P4,Q5,12/04/2018 11:18,"Did you google something in Liverpool?
I know that Facebook ads uses google search definitely."
P7,Q5,12/04/2018 11:18,"If you are in a website that has a share button, shres Facebook; Facebook knows that you've been in that website."
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:18,"No, I don't share my account with other website"
P7,Q5,12/04/2018 11:18,"Even if that website has a sort of Facebook button on it that you're not press the button necessarily, 
but it loads your data form Facebook and Facebook gets that request and knows that you are in Liverpool."
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:18,How come the loading data is allowed in Facebook?
P7,Q5,12/04/2018 11:18,Because that button comes from Facebook
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:18,"Without my permission to do, so again it's privacy violation."
P7,Q5,12/04/2018 11:18,Sure.
P4,Q5,12/04/2018 11:18,"Essentially, I'm not sure about the technical sense, so it doesn't mean that you actually are able to disable the location?"
P7,Q5,12/04/2018 11:19,"Anything that has Facebook button that means that you have been effective followed by Facebook user or non-user, that's the scary part of it."
P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:19,Facebook is too much power to control or to get information of our life. Again the problem is that Facebook has the permission to do this.
P4,Q5,12/04/2018 11:19,I think in this it was obvious that they don't have the means to tackle the issue and to address it properly
P7,Q5,12/04/2018 11:19,"I think the line is too flirting. When you say that you don't Facebook to follow you, but Facebook is taking that from you explicitly; not giving your location, it's not it as a sign that 
you don't be followed around and for them to learn the other ways. So, I think you should be clear when you say that you don't want them to know your location, don't know your location. 
That should be pretty obvious, right?"
P4,Q5,12/04/2018 11:20,Maybe in terms and conditions.
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:20,I think that's it. Do you have anything to add?
P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:20,"No, it's ok."
