P8,Q1,12/04/2018 11:30,Question is generally about time. The core of this point is. Essentially what want. Punishments to be. And. How we see the. Purpose of. Punishment. For criminals. So whether. We by the day we see the aim reeducation or. Isolation. Criminals or. Getting revenge. Because for me. It's not a topic that I have watched a lot about which to me seems. Because it says a death penalty has no deterrent effect. It seems that. It's. Like. The main. Reason for having it would be to get revenge. Or something. So I don't necessarily agree with it because it's treason. I think. That. The jail system and. The legal system should be about. Isolating dangerous people and. Reeducating people who. Ones. Who can be. I. Would go against. The family but I think. That criminals who. Do not. Who are seen as not. Not educable. People. Who. Have like a. Life plenty and think. People who will spend the rest of their lives in jail. I think they should have the option to. Choose. The. Penalty. Instead of. Spending the rest of their lives in jail. To. Be more humane.
P9,Q1,12/04/2018 11:32,"I'm with death plenty with some crimes. Such as murder. But, for some crimes, It's not that OKAY to have the death plenty as punishment. So for example for murder,It's going to be as it says here that the wounds will be open the rest of the life for the family members. But, for other crimes you should use the prison to re-develop criminal again and isolated for the society. This is my opinion.."
P10,Q1,12/04/2018 11:32,I think that penalty should be. Allowed for. Some of the crimes. For example. Especially I'm from India. So we have a lot of these. Rape cases. Which has been on the rise since so few years. And the case comes to the court and it just keeps going. Going into the other hearing another hearing but at the end of the day he just gets imprisonment for five or six years which. I don't think is justice for the family. I think for cases which require. Mitchelton the cases I think that penalty should be given. But. The same time. Some imprisonments like. For example our prime minister was kind of assassinated and. The. The murderers were actually kind of imprisoned for 25 years. And after 25 years the court comes and says that OK now it's time to come up with the death penalty which I don't think is really. It's too late. Twenty five years you've been in prison and then you come up with death plenty. So. I think it's. It's yes again as you said for some cases where it does require the person. Has done really. You know. I mean it's like. Like the karma of the cosmic law. So. The person has to die because he's done such a grave mistake. In some cases I don't think you need to. Really twenty five years and then you come up with a detriments and then there's no point in it. 
P8,Q1,12/04/2018 11:34,I keep wondering how does That penalty affect the family of the criminal. So. It's me. Me me me me me helped to heal. The wounds. Of. The family of the person who was murdered but then it would open a lot of new ones. Possibly. Maybe. Because I'm. Having. A criminal in the family can also carry a family apart. So these wounds may already be opened. By. The. Way so the family may already be negatively affected. Fighting crime and so. It's also about how. That county affects. More people. Than just The family of the person.
P9,Q1,12/04/2018 11:35,"So. I think the murder is just kind of justice. So. one family member involved one has died. So, No doubt to. Just. Hear the. Words. As it says here. We should. Make the death plenty for the. For the criminal. Then, It's it's equal. You know. It is Kind Of. Need to kill him if he did. "
P8,Q1,12/04/2018 11:35,That's actually helping him I think.
P9,Q1,12/04/2018 11:35,I mean it's going to be the problem and it's going to open the rest of the life. Especially in terms of murder. 
P8,Q1,12/04/2018 11:36,This justice a lot of cases and not a lot of cases but it has happened in the past. But that doesn't exactly that and then it turns out that the person was innocent.
P9,Q1,12/04/2018 11:36,Oh yes. It's.
P8,Q1,12/04/2018 11:36,Such a permanent thing that. There's no going back.
P9,Q1,12/04/2018 11:36,Yeah this is a good point. So to avoid this we of to have. So we have to be sure about the system. Just. To. Execute this. Plan. I think that it's. Very hard to
P8,Q1,12/04/2018 11:37,Place this level of trust in any kind of system.
P9,Q1,12/04/2018 11:37,You're Right.
P10,Q1,12/04/2018 11:37,I suppose like. Maybe. Let's say so the person who has done a crime which is not that kind as the death penalty in some country let's say let's say Saudi Arabia has been a country that gives. That penalties and Public Prosecutions and all of these things. But just like for that suppose the person is actually from UK and the UK government thinks that he's not been that kind of a crime and you not supposed to give that citizen. Of our country a kind of death penalty so it's again a huge issue. You know governments come into the picture and. Lot. When. There was. A. Recent news. I mean not the death penalty but. I think this is UK citizen she was an Iranian who got that UK citizenship. She was she was in Iran and there were some issues in the government. The UK government is ready to. Pay millions of pounds to get it back. But. Again. It's kind of complicated pretty are completely. How much star would you give. You know one star that you strongly disagree and five stars strongly agree. With three
P10,Q1,12/04/2018 11:38,Agree and disagree.
P9,Q1,12/04/2018 11:38,OK. i will go with yes wit some crimes. Like. The murder I totally agree.
P8,Q1,12/04/2018 11:38,"No. The death version, where the criminal wants it."
