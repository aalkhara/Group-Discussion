P1,Q1,12/04/2018 10:31,I'm not going for somebody else
P3,Q1,12/04/2018 10:31,"Well. I'm going have to definitely argue for you know. This case. Primarily because I was not really covered here. But, I think one of the strongest arguments against it is the idea of. False accusations. And so. We can't exactly take back. The death penalty as a form of punishment. That's not something that can be done. These sort of imprisonment. And later exoneration attack happen. Fairly often I'd say. So there. Is definitely a precedent for this shouldn't Be allowed.

P2,Q1,12/04/2018 10:32,Good
P1,Q1,12/04/2018 10:32,I also say no. I Think one of the other issues is. The people. Actually ingest the person or. Kill them and have a lot of psychological effects after they do so. And I think that. Is not. Covered as well.
P2,Q1,12/04/2018 10:32,"For me, I think yes. Because. Given the situation. Sometimes if he or she might defend herself, that's absolutely no. But, if without any crime just to kill someone. I think so. The fair thing. For his family or her family, to do the death plenty. That's what I think."
P1,Q1,12/04/2018 10:32,"What you can go somewhere you like. It does seem like it helps the families heal but I think sometimes it can also be a negative for families. Some. I think there is one case where the family was like, that's on our hands and we don't want to kill the person. So I think it just depends as well. "
P2,Q1,12/04/2018 10:33,But maybe. I think in my opinion It's fair. Because. Maybe in the future someone from this family kills someone from another family because they think that's fair for them. That's what I mean. 
P3,Q1,12/04/2018 10:33,I It's you're kind of arguing from. The crime of passion Angle to some extent
P3,Q1,12/04/2018 10:34,OK. But that's the thing though having having the death penalty doesn't just the amount of incidences of crimes of passion because. People sell are overcome by hatred or jealousy or whatever it drives them to. Commit these heinous crimes. And that doesn't change whether. Whether the death penalty has or isn't there. People so. Do these things. At which point you bloodied the hands of someone in the justice system. And you've created the system where. It's entirely possible. To be wrongly held as a result of justice.
P2,Q1,12/04/2018 10:34,What do you think the best Punishment for the?
P3,Q1,12/04/2018 10:34,Imprisonment I suppose. I don't think there's much else that can be done
P3,Q1,12/04/2018 10:34,That's humane. I mean you can argue in many cases that. Since most crimes of this nature are like crimes of passion or whatever rather than like. Totally motivated by cold blood or. I don't know. But by serial killers or something that most people are still. Able to be rehabilitated in some way. So is that not came to. Our moral obligation.
P1,Q1,12/04/2018 10:35,How long is a prison sentence first and does commit murder. I don't know. Because I think. There is a possibility of getting out
P1,Q1,12/04/2018 10:35,After some time. Do. You know since this is your topic. How long is it the prison sentence for someone who commits murder. Because I think that would be another thing that would strike a lot of fear if I knew that someone had killed my family member or something. And then I could I knew that the next year they were getting out that would be.
P3,Q1,12/04/2018 10:35,I think maybe a life sentence which is 20 years here
P2,Q1,12/04/2018 10:35,20 years!!
P3,Q1,12/04/2018 10:35,"I think so. I think it scales depending on circumstance of course but, I think that intensity was doled out."
