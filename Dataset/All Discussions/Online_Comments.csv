Negatives of Social Media: Best example to explain this would be the recent Facebook and Cambridge Analytica Data scandal. Our data and privacy are not safe. Personal data are used for many marketing purposes. Messages in messenger app are also scanned.

P15,12/04/2018 14:04,comment,J,,"In terms of procedural justice, there a complications in the methods to determine convictions. For instance, can we justify the death penalty for manslaughter? I do agree with other comments that suggest political malpractice that could manipulate the death penalty for corrupt government goals. Within this there is a concern over current laws on humanitarian topics such as illegality of certain sexual orientations or cultural allowances of discrimination.
Regarding distributive justice, although it may for a time satiate grievances, the death penalty does little to address the origins of issues. Thus I believe attention should be more focused to rehabilitation and prevention programmes.

P11,43202.54544,comment,Abeer,,"Personally , I think that some heinous crimes should be punishable by death , even if this is not going to heal the wounds of victims  but I will send a strong statement for people not to do it.   for example , premeditated killing someone is not acceptable if I'm going to regret it years later. However , for the current time , legal systems are full of problems or corrupted. Especially in some countries where governments can do that to punish their enemies, so I think no as it as it usually end up killing more innocent people.

P5,12/04/2018 13:04,reply,filomena,,"I think the bias of people is that if something is not acceptable, the only solution is a strong punishment. But, If we don't match it with something that help the guilty, the only punishment is not useful. Clearly, I think also victims need more support by society, because they often believe that they need only of justice, but this is not enough to solve the trauma.",http://aalkharashi1.wixsite.com/discussion-topics/politics

However, you will find someone call this freedom and ask to keep such a mess going on. Yes I'm with the authentic social media where every person speaks without any masks, and within moral discussion boundaries.

P13,43202.50365,reply,G,,"There's positive freedom and negative freedom, i.e., freedom to live your life without being discriminated against or without being targeted by violence (in this context, this could be hate speech). Neither of these cannot be fully enforced without limiting the other one. And I disagree that people know morals and share the same acceptable behaviour - this can wildly differ between different social groups (there are a lot of people who think that FGM is acceptable). So you can have social media with very little or even without any regulation, but it will almost certainly violate the negative freedom of some, perhaps more vulnerable members of the society.",http://aalkharashi1.wixsite.com/discussion-topics/soical-networks

P5,43202.462,comment,filomena,,"I don't agree with the death penalty. I think that if a person commits a murder, it's necessary a number of years of  imprisonment that is adequate, not only, to the crime, but also to the possibility of a social rehabilitation.
Punishment must be corrected during detention if the perpetrator improves his ability to return into society through a social rehabilitation program.
The death penalty teaches nothing and does not make our society better, while social rehabilitation during imprisonment could be an advantage.",http://aalkharashi1.wixsite.com/discussion-topics/politics

P1,43202.42043,comment,FelixMcFelix,,"In their current form? Hardly.
While I have issues with some of the pros and cons being simple correlations, I think the connectedness aspect is real and very beneficial. I'd argue that most folks end up achieving this through Whatsapp or somerthing similar rather than facebook et al., primarily since facebook devolves into a highlight reel of banal ""viral"" videos with occasional photos from friends.
It has become simply a way to kill time, including time that could be better used more productively.

For an average person, yes, they will see their friend’s baby or cat pictures showing up, but that can cause them stress and sadness if they haven’t sorted their life out yet. Also social media can have major impacts, such as using them to organise protests (eg. Arab Spring) or to manipulate votes (eg.

P3,12/04/2018 10:04,comment,ExNihilioNihilFit,,"I would argue a bit of both. As stated social media allows the spread of information, finding connections, and networking. However, there should also be some limits and stricter ruling within it. If it really does effect school grades so much, there should be something to overcome this (perhaps blocking certain sites on the school's wifi). The security is a big issue, and really needs to be addressed as well as harassment and safe spaces online. ",http://aalkharashi1.wixsite.com/discussion-topics/soical-networks

Since we do not know what having social media really means but they are here to stay, we should divert the question of how we regulate privacy data and crime committed through them (e.g. grooming).
