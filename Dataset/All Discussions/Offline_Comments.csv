P1,Q1,12/04/2018 10:31,I'm not going for somebody else
P3,Q1,12/04/2018 10:31,"Well. I'm going have to definitely argue for you know. This case. Primarily because I was not really covered here. But, I think one of the strongest arguments against it is the idea of. False accusations. And so. We can't exactly take back. The death penalty as a form of punishment. That's not something that can be done. These sort of imprisonment. And later exoneration attack happen. Fairly often I'd say. So there. Is definitely a precedent for this shouldn't Be allowed.
"
P2,Q1,12/04/2018 10:32,Good
P1,Q1,12/04/2018 10:32,I also say no. I Think one of the other issues is. The people. Actually ingest the person or. Kill them and have a lot of psychological effects after they do so. And I think that. Is not. Covered as well.
P2,Q1,12/04/2018 10:32,"For me, I think yes. Because. Given the situation. Sometimes if he or she might defend herself, that's absolutely no. But, if without any crime just to kill someone. I think so. The fair thing. For his family or her family, to do the death plenty. That's what I think."
P1,Q1,12/04/2018 10:32,"What you can go somewhere you like. It does seem like it helps the families heal but I think sometimes it can also be a negative for families. Some. I think there is one case where the family was like, that's on our hands and we don't want to kill the person. So I think it just depends as well. "
P2,Q1,12/04/2018 10:33,But maybe. I think in my opinion It's fair. Because. Maybe in the future someone from this family kills someone from another family because they think that's fair for them. That's what I mean. 
P3,Q1,12/04/2018 10:33,I It's you're kind of arguing from. The crime of passion Angle to some extent
P3,Q1,12/04/2018 10:34,OK. But that's the thing though having having the death penalty doesn't just the amount of incidences of crimes of passion because. People sell are overcome by hatred or jealousy or whatever it drives them to. Commit these heinous crimes. And that doesn't change whether. Whether the death penalty has or isn't there. People so. Do these things. At which point you bloodied the hands of someone in the justice system. And you've created the system where. It's entirely possible. To be wrongly held as a result of justice.
P2,Q1,12/04/2018 10:34,What do you think the best Punishment for the?
P3,Q1,12/04/2018 10:34,Imprisonment I suppose. I don't think there's much else that can be done
P3,Q1,12/04/2018 10:34,That's humane. I mean you can argue in many cases that. Since most crimes of this nature are like crimes of passion or whatever rather than like. Totally motivated by cold blood or. I don't know. But by serial killers or something that most people are still. Able to be rehabilitated in some way. So is that not came to. Our moral obligation.
P1,Q1,12/04/2018 10:35,How long is a prison sentence first and does commit murder. I don't know. Because I think. There is a possibility of getting out
P1,Q1,12/04/2018 10:35,After some time. Do. You know since this is your topic. How long is it the prison sentence for someone who commits murder. Because I think that would be another thing that would strike a lot of fear if I knew that someone had killed my family member or something. And then I could I knew that the next year they were getting out that would be.
P3,Q1,12/04/2018 10:35,I think maybe a life sentence which is 20 years here
P2,Q1,12/04/2018 10:35,20 years!!
P3,Q1,12/04/2018 10:35,"I think so. I think it scales depending on circumstance of course but, I think that intensity was doled out."
P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:01,"The use of social network has some pros and cons. The original idea of social networking is good because the original idea to share information and to connect people to socialise so is 
socialization is a good advantage weed reduces social network but there are lots of problems because the first a lot of 
false information is harder to discriminate between and false information especially is a problem for younger people they think because name create 
an idea of some topics and subjects that are completely wrong also the general idea of the life, what’s the life? What is socialization? What is the 
communication? The other problem that this dissertation is not a good situation because you don't know very well we are the people and the problem of 
the most I think not masturbate a lot of the Yankees that spend too much time near comfort computer and then the improvement Association the real life today. 
Today in the psychological effects of them with respect to this kind of problem she's a he became the use of Internet addiction support and respect people the
government controlled about 2 hours use of networking I think that government of two together more rules for example to control the society that put information in the internet "
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:02,Like China 
P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:02,"yeah yeah yeah Which city is the company that put advertisement because you go to get first I'm using it for me so big problem when they use social networking because 
I have an invention or advertisement and it's a bit stressful this kind of advertisement you click on a website and appeared to be advertisement . 
You cannot close the advertising before 10 or 15 seconds setting all this kind of invasion of false information they are not good for out for our, 
our healthy our psychological healthy and they think that the first action have two different sizes of the government not just so people because all 
I see is not simple to manage all kind of problems so what the problem is our government, I think. Mkes me feel upset also"
P4,Q5,12/04/2018 11:03,"You made a lot of different points in your speech.  I have a lot of points that i want to address, but I would like to focus on the main points, 
i think a lot of them is what you just said. Also, a lot of pros and cons that listed here. They kind of based under the assumption that the problems 
identified here and some of them identified by you, that are caused by social media but I tend to disagree that social media like never exits. 
It’s always exists like with the reputable society. It just enhance the way people behave so it's just, maybe it’s easier if i try to illustrate with an example. 
So, where it stays that social media enables the spread of unreliable and false information, 
I don't think this is true I think that it only makes it possible to spread false information faster and to spread on larger scale but the spread of false information, it was always existed."
P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:05,In what way we can quickly recognize the false information? I don’t know
P4,Q5,12/04/2018 11:06,"I think it’s all about educating users about how recognize false news, about how to identify reliable sources and encouraging independent thinking. 
Also, disencouraging and bad healthy habits and bad healthy lifestyle. This way people can use social media platforms without having a negative effects in their 
social life without being a victim of addiction. I think lots of these negative habits people develop regressive habits and they have natural tendency because we human we always 
go with the easier way, and a lot of times it’s easier to socialize online than it’s to go out, meeting people -- someone who is highly shy. 
So in the same way that enforcement law use to catch criminals. Also criminals can make use of social media, the problem still exists and it would exist without the social media, 
they would just different form, I think?   To say about the government, I also disagree that the government should significantly interfere. I think either some regulation might be necessary. 
For example, protecting private data of citizens, and remembering the Facebook incident, which happened so recently. "
P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:06,I think the disadvantage is that you have less freedom of the government put a lot of rules and what kind of people you can find on the internet.
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:07,"I think you're right. I remember one of my frenids he is chineese and said that they have thier own soical media or soical network website like Facebook or twiter. 
So all members of that website are from china and they are not open to the world. I think this is the adantage of government control of social networks websites"
P7,Q5,12/04/2018 11:07,"I don't think it's necessarily the problem with china, I think the problem with china is that the government can define different things that are allowed to be discussed"
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:07,We are taking china as an example
P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:07,I think China is an extreme example
P7,Q5,12/04/2018 11:07,"The government controls what kind of discussion points can be made, I think this can quickly kill the discussion"
P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:08,"I think the example of china is a bit extreme, I mean I intend a government like American government or european government can put rules to control, for example the company that put information 
on the internet or for example Facebook if it catches a lot of our information and the government has to control this process."
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:08,"I think this relates to a cyber-attack wars between these countries like US, UK, China and Saudi Arabia and different countries. So they try to control their people from spreading 
information in public social networking sites. For, example, I’m going to a holiday, going to Liverpool for one week, so maybe someone will track my location to steal things from my 
home while I’m away. So, this is the main concern for me when I’m losing the social media. Privacy, there is no privacy for the social networking. Whatever you post online it’s for 
everyone to see. It doesn't belong to you anymore. I think, the owner of social networking like Facebook or twitter they need to teach users how set their own privacy to protect their 
information from misuse. We’re using just for fun, we’re carless."
P7,Q5,12/04/2018 11:09,"You wanted to share that you’re going to holiday and I you should be able to do that, but be clear who you’re sharing with and what privacy you’re giving up. 
I don’t think it’s necessary to impose rules around privacy. You should be clear that you’re giving up that kind of information."
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:10,"Yeah, you’re right, for me I know the rules, the privacy rules in Facebook, so only my friends going to see the post. But, someone who has no idea about the technology and don’t 
know what the privacy really mean, can be an issue. "
P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:10,"I think that when you know how to use Facebook then you manage your privacy, but the problem young people prbly are not responsible and do not have the knowledge to manage thier privacy 
So, I think also the government has to orginze soical events. I do not know, to educate people use the internet toward the pricvay and how to use the privacy beause most of the people use 
the internet just to give our infomation my holiday, my boyfreind."
P4,Q5,12/04/2018 11:11,"Yes, I defently agree on understanding what you exactly doing on the social networking website is very important, but also I think the recent Facebook exmaple it shows also the actor 
who creates the social networking website might have business interest that interfer kind of good cause, like for example, misburger allowed data to be leaked. 
It also shows is not all down to the user. But the actor behind the soical netowrk might meet the violation of private data withiut the consent of the user"
P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:12,"I think even if we put the restrications in our pricay, it is not enoungh becuase the web for example, Facebook are able to capture our information. We don not know, for example, sometimes 
I look for an aprtment to go on holiday, and then I open my mail and I have the advertising of an aprtment in the place I checked."
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:12,Yeah it happend to me last week.
P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:12,"So, I can not control this kind of effect becuase the government has too much freedom to capture our information. 
So, I think only the government can only get some actions to change this kind of process."
P4,Q5,12/04/2018 11:13,"But we are talking within the context of western government, but there are a lot of diffrent governments in the world, for example, in Trkey I rember when the government took contol 
of social media espaicply when there were protesting and a lot of people are aginst that the society is very divided and a lot of people want to hare lets say polioce violance on Youtube
or Facebook just to see what's happinging, but this content is ofter taken down and a lot of people have been arrested for sharing something that disagrees with the offical position
aginst their policy. So I don't think it's good. The govenment can use social media to hurt citizens as well. So I think it's different from one conutry to another"
P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:14,Yeah I think it depends on the country. This the problem maybe that we have different cultures and different rules is bit complicated
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:15,"I think it's time consuming as well. For me when I come here to my office in the university, I put my mobile in silent mode and then I looked, at the end of the day I take my mobile. 
So I just try to save my time because I'm a big fan of following famous people in Twitter, and I like to make an argument and debates about specific topic about politics debates. 
So I just realized that my time is consumed and my performance in the university goes down and affects my productivity. So I decided to silent my mobile and focus on my work. 
So this is another disatna the of the social networking, because once you enter any debate or an argument, you can not get out, your mind is still thinking about the topic. 
You can not focus in your task."
P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:16,"Yeah, this is right, but the problem that a lot of young people are not able to silence their phones, for example, I know in the past a patient young guy that was addicted to online video 
games and which you have to play and engage with other people and he was not able to pause and go for example to the bathroom. It was strange addiction. It is a problem of family and parents
because they are not able to educate these people, but it also a problem to our society."
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:17,I think we agree to sum up the education and to increase the awaness of end users. I think these are the most important for the sociality and social networking
P4,Q5,12/04/2018 11:17,"I think social media has benefits, but you have to find the blance."
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:17,"Yeah, and they have to respect our privacy as well. Even as I said I was in Liverpool last week, I disabled the location from Facebook. When I arrived here to Glasgow, 
they send me kind of ads from Liverpool. How come? But in the privacy I disabled everything that shows my location, so they still know where am I."
P4,Q5,12/04/2018 11:18,"Did you google something in Liverpool?
I know that Facebook ads uses google search definitely."
P7,Q5,12/04/2018 11:18,"If you are in a website that has a share button, shres Facebook; Facebook knows that you've been in that website."
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:18,"No, I don't share my account with other website"
P7,Q5,12/04/2018 11:18,"Even if that website has a sort of Facebook button on it that you're not press the button necessarily, 
but it loads your data form Facebook and Facebook gets that request and knows that you are in Liverpool."
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:18,How come the loading data is allowed in Facebook?
P7,Q5,12/04/2018 11:18,Because that button comes from Facebook
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:18,"Without my permission to do, so again it's privacy violation."
P7,Q5,12/04/2018 11:18,Sure.
P4,Q5,12/04/2018 11:18,"Essentially, I'm not sure about the technical sense, so it doesn't mean that you actually are able to disable the location?"
P7,Q5,12/04/2018 11:19,"Anything that has Facebook button that means that you have been effective followed by Facebook user or non-user, that's the scary part of it."
P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:19,Facebook is too much power to control or to get information of our life. Again the problem is that Facebook has the permission to do this.
P4,Q5,12/04/2018 11:19,I think in this it was obvious that they don't have the means to tackle the issue and to address it properly
P7,Q5,12/04/2018 11:19,"I think the line is too flirting. When you say that you don't Facebook to follow you, but Facebook is taking that from you explicitly; not giving your location, it's not it as a sign that 
you don't be followed around and for them to learn the other ways. So, I think you should be clear when you say that you don't want them to know your location, don't know your location. 
That should be pretty obvious, right?"
P4,Q5,12/04/2018 11:20,Maybe in terms and conditions.
P6,Q5,12/04/2018 11:20,I think that's it. Do you have anything to add?
P5,Q5,12/04/2018 11:20,"No, it's ok."
P8,Q1,12/04/2018 11:30,Question is generally about time. The core of this point is. Essentially what want. Punishments to be. And. How we see the. Purpose of. Punishment. For criminals. So whether. We by the day we see the aim reeducation or. Isolation. Criminals or. Getting revenge. Because for me. It's not a topic that I have watched a lot about which to me seems. Because it says a death penalty has no deterrent effect. It seems that. It's. Like. The main. Reason for having it would be to get revenge. Or something. So I don't necessarily agree with it because it's treason. I think. That. The jail system and. The legal system should be about. Isolating dangerous people and. Reeducating people who. Ones. Who can be. I. Would go against. The family but I think. That criminals who. Do not. Who are seen as not. Not educable. People. Who. Have like a. Life plenty and think. People who will spend the rest of their lives in jail. I think they should have the option to. Choose. The. Penalty. Instead of. Spending the rest of their lives in jail. To. Be more humane.
P9,Q1,12/04/2018 11:32,"I'm with death plenty with some crimes. Such as murder. But, for some crimes, It's not that OKAY to have the death plenty as punishment. So for example for murder,It's going to be as it says here that the wounds will be open the rest of the life for the family members. But, for other crimes you should use the prison to re-develop criminal again and isolated for the society. This is my opinion.."
P10,Q1,12/04/2018 11:32,I think that penalty should be. Allowed for. Some of the crimes. For example. Especially I'm from India. So we have a lot of these. Rape cases. Which has been on the rise since so few years. And the case comes to the court and it just keeps going. Going into the other hearing another hearing but at the end of the day he just gets imprisonment for five or six years which. I don't think is justice for the family. I think for cases which require. Mitchelton the cases I think that penalty should be given. But. The same time. Some imprisonments like. For example our prime minister was kind of assassinated and. The. The murderers were actually kind of imprisoned for 25 years. And after 25 years the court comes and says that OK now it's time to come up with the death penalty which I don't think is really. It's too late. Twenty five years you've been in prison and then you come up with death plenty. So. I think it's. It's yes again as you said for some cases where it does require the person. Has done really. You know. I mean it's like. Like the karma of the cosmic law. So. The person has to die because he's done such a grave mistake. In some cases I don't think you need to. Really twenty five years and then you come up with a detriments and then there's no point in it. 
P8,Q1,12/04/2018 11:34,I keep wondering how does That penalty affect the family of the criminal. So. It's me. Me me me me me helped to heal. The wounds. Of. The family of the person who was murdered but then it would open a lot of new ones. Possibly. Maybe. Because I'm. Having. A criminal in the family can also carry a family apart. So these wounds may already be opened. By. The. Way so the family may already be negatively affected. Fighting crime and so. It's also about how. That county affects. More people. Than just The family of the person.
P9,Q1,12/04/2018 11:35,"So. I think the murder is just kind of justice. So. one family member involved one has died. So, No doubt to. Just. Hear the. Words. As it says here. We should. Make the death plenty for the. For the criminal. Then, It's it's equal. You know. It is Kind Of. Need to kill him if he did. "
P8,Q1,12/04/2018 11:35,That's actually helping him I think.
P9,Q1,12/04/2018 11:35,I mean it's going to be the problem and it's going to open the rest of the life. Especially in terms of murder. 
P8,Q1,12/04/2018 11:36,This justice a lot of cases and not a lot of cases but it has happened in the past. But that doesn't exactly that and then it turns out that the person was innocent.
P9,Q1,12/04/2018 11:36,Oh yes. It's.
P8,Q1,12/04/2018 11:36,Such a permanent thing that. There's no going back.
P9,Q1,12/04/2018 11:36,Yeah this is a good point. So to avoid this we of to have. So we have to be sure about the system. Just. To. Execute this. Plan. I think that it's. Very hard to
P8,Q1,12/04/2018 11:37,Place this level of trust in any kind of system.
P9,Q1,12/04/2018 11:37,You're Right.
P10,Q1,12/04/2018 11:37,I suppose like. Maybe. Let's say so the person who has done a crime which is not that kind as the death penalty in some country let's say let's say Saudi Arabia has been a country that gives. That penalties and Public Prosecutions and all of these things. But just like for that suppose the person is actually from UK and the UK government thinks that he's not been that kind of a crime and you not supposed to give that citizen. Of our country a kind of death penalty so it's again a huge issue. You know governments come into the picture and. Lot. When. There was. A. Recent news. I mean not the death penalty but. I think this is UK citizen she was an Iranian who got that UK citizenship. She was she was in Iran and there were some issues in the government. The UK government is ready to. Pay millions of pounds to get it back. But. Again. It's kind of complicated pretty are completely. How much star would you give. You know one star that you strongly disagree and five stars strongly agree. With three
P10,Q1,12/04/2018 11:38,Agree and disagree.
P9,Q1,12/04/2018 11:38,OK. i will go with yes wit some crimes. Like. The murder I totally agree.
P8,Q1,12/04/2018 11:38,"No. The death version, where the criminal wants it."
P8,Q5,12/04/2018 12:00,"That. You have. To like. Every like everything had a. Good side and bad side. But, it is filling a gap. Because like millions of users use it now. So. It is actually a good thing, apparently. How to use it. Or. If you like. If you come to the television. I didn't know. Drinking whatever. Anything in the world that just has a good side and a bad side. So if people use it wrongly. Yeah it is bad. It's a good thing."
P13,Q5,12/04/2018 12:00,Yeah. That doesn't mean. BREAKING. People's privacy. Breach. 
P12,Q5,12/04/2018 12:01,Like Facebook. 
P13,Q5,12/04/2018 12:01,You know what he's facing several data breaches. Otherwise it's good.
P11,Q5,12/04/2018 12:01,Yeah. I mean that. We didn't realise how powerful our information like. For me. Yeah. Like can. Can get. These points we didn't really. Consider it to be happening. It's technology that we developed. Our mistake apparently that we did. 
P13,Q5,12/04/2018 12:01,I don't think they'll be that satisfies each and every aspect.
P15,Q5,12/04/2018 12:02,I guess it's largely the way things are are saying it's not necessarily psychology inherently negative but that's all. It's the way. It. Yeah especially with the claim that students who are heavy social media users tend to have lower grades like that's. Like a correlation or a causation doesn't necessarily mean because of social media they have bad grades. They may just have bad grades in general or just have bad habits and therefore use social media and also I filtrate so. It's lots question there.
P13,Q5,12/04/2018 12:02,It's good.
P12,Q5,12/04/2018 12:02,And the same time you don't get thoughts from. For example research you need to know very-well to boost your research. Why but you still have it on Twitter. Yes. So with good things to think about is social insurance for things like I don't want to share right now. Yeah.
P14,Q5,12/04/2018 12:00,But social media. Just. Depends on What you're doing now.
P13,Q5,12/04/2018 12:03,Yeah I think our focus here is not our behaviour toward the tool.
P14,Q5,12/04/2018 12:03,"Yeah Yeah, I got it I got it."
P13,Q5,12/04/2018 12:03,"The focus. The tool is beneficial to our society or not. For me, I think it's very beneficial."
P14,Q5,12/04/2018 12:03,Yeah. For sure.
P13,Q5,12/04/2018 12:03,"Regardless of my behaviour and your behaviour, my intention and your intention. "
P11,Q5,12/04/2018 12:03,If you think. Like. I didn't know from economical way that a lot of people start doing business through social media. This point Yeah and these people wouldn't have this kind of. Job. A lot of people working for them. Improving the. Economy of. This. Country didn't have this kind of tool. Because some people it's really hard to go outside and go to other jobs. But. People.
P13,Q5,12/04/2018 12:04,I remember first being here. My friend from Ghana Told me oh don't buy a phone from any shop. I'll get you one from Facebook and I was about to go looking for shops and immediately he bought the phone for me.
P12,Q5,12/04/2018 12:04,It used to be the way to contact people. I. Think it's a great time as well in different countries. There are different. Uses. Different type of technology being used in there for example here in U.K. they use facebook much more than. Other. Like. Said. Than Twitter maybe or Instagram WhatsApp but other countries they use. Different. Websites. Yeah and it can be used politically either in a good way or bad way you know to. Change. The political view to. Encourage people to do something to. Change the regulation. You know. So. Yes can be a good thing. Is it. Used in a positive way or can bad thing if it's used for. Whatever. Reason. Not. Good.
P11,Q5,12/04/2018 12:05,For the second. Group. Social media like privacy is exposed to Government. I think this is. Good news for example me. Do you think this is more of a problem with law enforcement. Because this technology is. Relatively new. It's not really these people it's not really up to these. And we still need time to. Build. Some kind of. Laws. That will manage this kind. Of. Social media rules. And that the data management Control.
P13,Q5,12/04/2018 12:06,Yeah
P11,Q5,12/04/2018 12:06,I think this is a problem with the government not the actual social media.
P15,Q5,12/04/2018 12:06,Recently there's a crackdown with GDRB GDBR the new. Social media or media. Laws. Are Just passe Svetozar. I think it's coming out just like fully released in June. So like. Yeah. So I don't know any apps recently but they like how this whole thing like. You can do what you were talking about. For. So. There is a. Strong issue of privacy.
P11,Q5,12/04/2018 12:07,I think. The. Fiscal problem I think more countries will start. Building. Of. Laws. And. So I. Predict. That. People. The. Concept of. Big countries or strong countries can force this kind of close with. Countries. That. Truly want to have this Influence to stop them. The problem. Is. This social media start to being something global. In. The. Country. And Facebook. Google in this kind of. Stuff. Because they're. Too small to be considered like American. Or something. Known. As. Global things that. We don't know how to. It. Or. Force them. To. Apply to them. And. We are going to be part of this problem to. Be dealing with how to enforce these rules actually. And. Networks. Compete with the others.
P11,Q5,12/04/2018 12:08,And how about the last One?
P14,Q5,12/04/2018 12:08,Cons?

P14,Q5,12/04/2018 12:08,More on online relationships more than a lack of life lessons. I think. It's not. Just people talking about networking online. For example LinkedIn or. Facebook or whatever but. In reality. There is nothing. Just like online people you know them both virtual Yeah it's actually. Really.
P13,Q5,12/04/2018 12:09,Virtual relationship. Virtual which means haha
P11,Q5,12/04/2018 12:09,I think it's not a problem. That. cased by Facebook. Just like Modern society. Actually. We still Have to deal with. The. Because. People get a. Problem with the relationship. Without. The. People that want more.
P12,Q5,12/04/2018 12:09,With these jobs. It's like. Getting lost because normally when you walk. Anywhere or. Go anywhere. Meet any person normally find people around you like using their phone and they know it's like. Because of their in talking to people around them. You know. So nothing at all just like being there. But not there is no connection at all. Using phone or not. Nothing. Just contacting their virtual friends.
P11,Q5,12/04/2018 12:10,We have to deal with it.
P14,Q5,12/04/2018 12:10,The generation. I mean when I sit with my nephews and nieces they are. Just. Playing with their phones and. I start talking with them what's going on with you guys. Talking to you. an they say we are in the middle of phone conversation then I say Yeah that's ok. I will play with my phone too
P13,Q5,12/04/2018 12:10,It's. Great problem that you are facing deal with culture. Information Age. We. Need to. Set up strategy to deal with that. Otherwise. the tool itself is inefficient to our society

P12,Q5,12/04/2018 12:10,In the same time. There's a good side of it which is. The last point the. Positive Side which is. Not. Conducting. Connected. To. Like. My situation to my back home. There is anything new mean changes so it's easier to. Be updated about anything in there. And. I think it's not too frequent because normally it's hard to follow up on. The news updates. With. The style of. Communication is easy.
