P15,12/04/2018 14:04,comment,J,,"In terms of procedural justice, there a complications in the methods to determine convictions. For instance, can we justify the death penalty for manslaughter? I do agree with other comments that suggest political malpractice that could manipulate the death penalty for corrupt government goals. Within this there is a concern over current laws on humanitarian topics such as illegality of certain sexual orientations or cultural allowances of discrimination.
Regarding distributive justice, although it may for a time satiate grievances, the death penalty does little to address the origins of issues. Thus I believe attention should be more focused to rehabilitation and prevention programmes.

P11,43202.54544,comment,Abeer,,"Personally , I think that some heinous crimes should be punishable by death , even if this is not going to heal the wounds of victimsÂ  but I will send a strong statement for people not to do it.Â Â  for example , premeditated killing someone is not acceptable if I'm going to regret it years later. However , for the current time , legal systems are full of problems or corrupted. Especially in some countries where governments can do that to punish their enemies, so I think no as it as it usually end up killing more innocent people.

P5,12/04/2018 13:04,reply,filomena,,"I think the bias of people is that if something is not acceptable, the only solution is a strong punishment. But, If we don't match it with something that help the guilty, the only punishment is not useful. Clearly, I think also victims need more support by society, because they often believe that they need only of justice, but this is not enough to solve the trauma.",http://aalkharashi1.wixsite.com/discussion-topics/politics
P5,43202.462,comment,filomena,,"I don't agree with the death penalty. I think that if a person commits a murder, it's necessary a number of years ofÂ  imprisonment that is adequate, not only, to the crime, but also to the possibility of a social rehabilitation.
Punishment must be corrected during detention if the perpetrator improves his ability to return into society through a social rehabilitation program.
The death penalty teaches nothing and does not make our society better, while social rehabilitation during imprisonment could be an advantage.",http://aalkharashi1.wixsite.com/discussion-topics/politics

P12,12/04/2018 12:04,reply,Bob,,But it does: it implies that is OK to kill someone if they are found guilty of breaking certain laws. ,http://aalkharashi1.wixsite.com/discussion-topics/politics
