P1,Q1,12/04/2018 10:31,I'm not going for somebody else
P3,Q1,12/04/2018 10:31,"Well. I'm going have to definitely argue for you know. This case. Primarily because I was not really covered here. But, I think one of the strongest arguments against it is the idea of. False accusations. And so. We can't exactly take back. The death penalty as a form of punishment. That's not something that can be done. These sort of imprisonment. And later exoneration attack happen. Fairly often I'd say. So there. Is definitely a precedent for this shouldn't Be allowed.
"
P2,Q1,12/04/2018 10:32,Good
P1,Q1,12/04/2018 10:32,I also say no. I Think one of the other issues is. The people. Actually ingest the person or. Kill them and have a lot of psychological effects after they do so. And I think that. Is not. Covered as well.
P2,Q1,12/04/2018 10:32,"For me, I think yes. Because. Given the situation. Sometimes if he or she might defend herself, that's absolutely no. But, if without any crime just to kill someone. I think so. The fair thing. For his family or her family, to do the death plenty. That's what I think."
P1,Q1,12/04/2018 10:32,"What you can go somewhere you like. It does seem like it helps the families heal but I think sometimes it can also be a negative for families. Some. I think there is one case where the family was like, that's on our hands and we don't want to kill the person. So I think it just depends as well. "
P2,Q1,12/04/2018 10:33,But maybe. I think in my opinion It's fair. Because. Maybe in the future someone from this family kills someone from another family because they think that's fair for them. That's what I mean. 
P3,Q1,12/04/2018 10:33,I It's you're kind of arguing from. The crime of passion Angle to some extent
P3,Q1,12/04/2018 10:34,OK. But that's the thing though having having the death penalty doesn't just the amount of incidences of crimes of passion because. People sell are overcome by hatred or jealousy or whatever it drives them to. Commit these heinous crimes. And that doesn't change whether. Whether the death penalty has or isn't there. People so. Do these things. At which point you bloodied the hands of someone in the justice system. And you've created the system where. It's entirely possible. To be wrongly held as a result of justice.
P2,Q1,12/04/2018 10:34,What do you think the best Punishment for the?
P3,Q1,12/04/2018 10:34,Imprisonment I suppose. I don't think there's much else that can be done
P3,Q1,12/04/2018 10:34,That's humane. I mean you can argue in many cases that. Since most crimes of this nature are like crimes of passion or whatever rather than like. Totally motivated by cold blood or. I don't know. But by serial killers or something that most people are still. Able to be rehabilitated in some way. So is that not came to. Our moral obligation.
P1,Q1,12/04/2018 10:35,How long is a prison sentence first and does commit murder. I don't know. Because I think. There is a possibility of getting out
P1,Q1,12/04/2018 10:35,After some time. Do. You know since this is your topic. How long is it the prison sentence for someone who commits murder. Because I think that would be another thing that would strike a lot of fear if I knew that someone had killed my family member or something. And then I could I knew that the next year they were getting out that would be.
P3,Q1,12/04/2018 10:35,I think maybe a life sentence which is 20 years here
P2,Q1,12/04/2018 10:35,20 years!!
P3,Q1,12/04/2018 10:35,"I think so. I think it scales depending on circumstance of course but, I think that intensity was doled out."
P8,Q1,12/04/2018 11:30,Question is generally about time. The core of this point is. Essentially what want. Punishments to be. And. How we see the. Purpose of. Punishment. For criminals. So whether. We by the day we see the aim reeducation or. Isolation. Criminals or. Getting revenge. Because for me. It's not a topic that I have watched a lot about which to me seems. Because it says a death penalty has no deterrent effect. It seems that. It's. Like. The main. Reason for having it would be to get revenge. Or something. So I don't necessarily agree with it because it's treason. I think. That. The jail system and. The legal system should be about. Isolating dangerous people and. Reeducating people who. Ones. Who can be. I. Would go against. The family but I think. That criminals who. Do not. Who are seen as not. Not educable. People. Who. Have like a. Life plenty and think. People who will spend the rest of their lives in jail. I think they should have the option to. Choose. The. Penalty. Instead of. Spending the rest of their lives in jail. To. Be more humane.
P9,Q1,12/04/2018 11:32,"I'm with death plenty with some crimes. Such as murder. But, for some crimes, It's not that OKAY to have the death plenty as punishment. So for example for murder,It's going to be as it says here that the wounds will be open the rest of the life for the family members. But, for other crimes you should use the prison to re-develop criminal again and isolated for the society. This is my opinion.."
P10,Q1,12/04/2018 11:32,I think that penalty should be. Allowed for. Some of the crimes. For example. Especially I'm from India. So we have a lot of these. Rape cases. Which has been on the rise since so few years. And the case comes to the court and it just keeps going. Going into the other hearing another hearing but at the end of the day he just gets imprisonment for five or six years which. I don't think is justice for the family. I think for cases which require. Mitchelton the cases I think that penalty should be given. But. The same time. Some imprisonments like. For example our prime minister was kind of assassinated and. The. The murderers were actually kind of imprisoned for 25 years. And after 25 years the court comes and says that OK now it's time to come up with the death penalty which I don't think is really. It's too late. Twenty five years you've been in prison and then you come up with death plenty. So. I think it's. It's yes again as you said for some cases where it does require the person. Has done really. You know. I mean it's like. Like the karma of the cosmic law. So. The person has to die because he's done such a grave mistake. In some cases I don't think you need to. Really twenty five years and then you come up with a detriments and then there's no point in it. 
P8,Q1,12/04/2018 11:34,I keep wondering how does That penalty affect the family of the criminal. So. It's me. Me me me me me helped to heal. The wounds. Of. The family of the person who was murdered but then it would open a lot of new ones. Possibly. Maybe. Because I'm. Having. A criminal in the family can also carry a family apart. So these wounds may already be opened. By. The. Way so the family may already be negatively affected. Fighting crime and so. It's also about how. That county affects. More people. Than just The family of the person.
P9,Q1,12/04/2018 11:35,"So. I think the murder is just kind of justice. So. one family member involved one has died. So, No doubt to. Just. Hear the. Words. As it says here. We should. Make the death plenty for the. For the criminal. Then, It's it's equal. You know. It is Kind Of. Need to kill him if he did. "
P8,Q1,12/04/2018 11:35,That's actually helping him I think.
P9,Q1,12/04/2018 11:35,I mean it's going to be the problem and it's going to open the rest of the life. Especially in terms of murder. 
P8,Q1,12/04/2018 11:36,This justice a lot of cases and not a lot of cases but it has happened in the past. But that doesn't exactly that and then it turns out that the person was innocent.
P9,Q1,12/04/2018 11:36,Oh yes. It's.
P8,Q1,12/04/2018 11:36,Such a permanent thing that. There's no going back.
P9,Q1,12/04/2018 11:36,Yeah this is a good point. So to avoid this we of to have. So we have to be sure about the system. Just. To. Execute this. Plan. I think that it's. Very hard to
P8,Q1,12/04/2018 11:37,Place this level of trust in any kind of system.
P9,Q1,12/04/2018 11:37,You're Right.
P10,Q1,12/04/2018 11:37,I suppose like. Maybe. Let's say so the person who has done a crime which is not that kind as the death penalty in some country let's say let's say Saudi Arabia has been a country that gives. That penalties and Public Prosecutions and all of these things. But just like for that suppose the person is actually from UK and the UK government thinks that he's not been that kind of a crime and you not supposed to give that citizen. Of our country a kind of death penalty so it's again a huge issue. You know governments come into the picture and. Lot. When. There was. A. Recent news. I mean not the death penalty but. I think this is UK citizen she was an Iranian who got that UK citizenship. She was she was in Iran and there were some issues in the government. The UK government is ready to. Pay millions of pounds to get it back. But. Again. It's kind of complicated pretty are completely. How much star would you give. You know one star that you strongly disagree and five stars strongly agree. With three
P10,Q1,12/04/2018 11:38,Agree and disagree.
P9,Q1,12/04/2018 11:38,OK. i will go with yes wit some crimes. Like. The murder I totally agree.
P8,Q1,12/04/2018 11:38,"No. The death version, where the criminal wants it."
