Negatives of Social Media: Best example to explain this would be the recent Facebook and Cambridge Analytica Data scandal. Our data and privacy are not safe. Personal data are used for many marketing purposes. Messages in messenger app are also scanned.

P9,43202.46199,comment,A,,"I think social media is a mess. Any thing without regulation, rules, and restrictions will turn in as a wild. However, you will find someone call this freedom and ask to keep such a mess going on. Yes I'm with the authentic social media where every person speaks without any masks, and within moral discussion boundaries.

P13,43202.50365,reply,G,,"There's positive freedom and negative freedom, i.e., freedom to live your life without being discriminated against or without being targeted by violence (in this context, this could be hate speech). Neither of these cannot be fully enforced without limiting the other one. And I disagree that people know morals and share the same acceptable behaviour - this can wildly differ between different social groups (there are a lot of people who think that FGM is acceptable). So you can have social media with very little or even without any regulation, but it will almost certainly violate the negative freedom of some, perhaps more vulnerable members of the society.",http://aalkharashi1.wixsite.com/discussion-topics/soical-networks

P1,43202.42043,comment,FelixMcFelix,,"In their current form? Hardly.While I have issues with some of the pros and cons being simple correlations, I think the connectedness aspect is real and very beneficial. I'd argue that most folks end up achieving this through Whatsapp or somerthing similar rather than facebook et al., primarily since facebook devolves into a highlight reel of banal ""viral"" videos with occasional photos from friends.
It has become simply a way to kill time, including time that could be better used more productively.",http://aalkharashi1.wixsite.com/discussion-topics/soical-networks
P4,43202.46194,reply,Konstantina,,"I don't know about that. For an average person, yes, they will see their friend's baby or cat pictures showing up, but that can cause them stress and sadness if they have't sorted their life out yet. Also social media can have major impacts, such as using them to organise protests (eg. Arab Spring) or to manipulate votes (eg. Cambridge Analytica).

P9,12/04/2018 11:04,reply,A,,"I think you are right, the privacy is so important in such systems, but it can be controlled and improved by the effort and research being carried out by the security, privacy, and behaviour people .",http://aalkharashi1.wixsite.com/discussion-topics/soical-networks
P3,12/04/2018 10:04,comment,ExNihilioNihilFit,,"I would argue a bit of both. As stated social media allows the spread of information, finding connections, and networking. However, there should also be some limits and stricter ruling within it. If it really does effect school grades so much, there should be something to overcome this (perhaps blocking certain sites on the school's wifi). The security is a big issue, and really needs to be addressed as well as harassment and safe spaces online. ",http://aalkharashi1.wixsite.com/discussion-topics/soical-networks
P4,43202.42042,comment,Konstantina,,"I have not yet set my mind to this one. It is too early to have an opinion for something it is still being formed. Since we do not know what having social media really means but they are here to stay, we should divert the question of how we regulate privacy data and crime committed through them (e.g. grooming). There is no point in fighting the future, we need to adapt to it and mould it to the best of our interests.",http://aalkharashi1.wixsite.com/discussion-topics/soical-networks
